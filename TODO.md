# To Do
- Scrape tooltip text. May require jQuery library?
- Back and Forward arrow to cycle between hotspots.
- Add in visited pano functionality
- Add in pano-editor setting to toggle between unseen/all hotspot cycling.
- Add to `styles.tmpl` data-attr to enable or disable on-screen content view (will be useful for visited-pano coding.)
